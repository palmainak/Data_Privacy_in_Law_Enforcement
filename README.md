This is a basic prototype model for ensuring data privacy. Our final model will try to mask sensitive data in such a way that only authorized users can get access to the sensitive information and others can only see the masked data. In this repository, we have provided a codes for a basic website which will be improved in the future. We have also provided a python code for running the NER model which will classify different entities using different tags. This is just the first step of the final model and it will be given much more improvements in the future.
